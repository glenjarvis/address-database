address-database
================

A C project for a binary file format address book (for an academic project, not
production)


Background
----------

This was a project for a basic introduction to C at UC-Berkeley (I needed
another credit hour to finish my Linux/Unix Certification program at UC
Berkeley).

Since this was an introductory class, I followed the suggestions for the
assignment (even if there were other libraries or more accepted standards in
the industry).
